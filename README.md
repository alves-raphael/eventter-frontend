# Event List Front End - In All Media Challenge

## Requirements
In order to run this you need to have both node.js and npm installed. I personally used the node 21.0 version.

## Dependency installation and execution
after cloning the repository, open the directory in the terminal and run `npm install`. After the installation is finished, run `npm run dev` 

In the terminal will ne show the port which will be running the app, just like `localhost:1573`

### Observation
Make sure all the wordpress back is already setup before in order to work properly
